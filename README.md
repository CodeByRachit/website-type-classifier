A robust FastAPI application that classifies the type of a given website (e.g., E-commerce, News, Blog, Corporate) using a hybrid approach. It combines powerful Machine Learning models with intelligent heuristic rules for accurate and reliable classification.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Hybrid Classification Engine**: Utilizes a trained scikit-learn model (Logistic Regression with TF-IDF features) alongside a comprehensive set of heuristic rules (keywords, domain suffixes, structural checks) for enhanced accuracy.
* **FastAPI Backend**: Provides a high-performance, asynchronous API for website classification.
* **Simple Web UI**: Includes a basic, embedded React-based frontend for easy testing and demonstration directly from your browser.
* **Extensible**: Easily extendable with new website types, refined heuristics, or updated ML models by training with more diverse data.
* **Robust Web Scraping**: Handles common issues like missing URL schemes and uses appropriate headers for fetching website content.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Website Type Classifier API on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10 or higher (as seen in your screenshot, `python 3.10.11`)
* `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/website-type-classifier.git](https://github.com/your-username/website-type-classifier.git)
    cd website-type-classifier
    ```
    *(Replace `https://github.com/your-username/website-type-classifier.git` with your actual repository URL)*

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    It's good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

    * **On Windows:**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **On macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install Dependencies:**
    First, you'll need a `requirements.txt` file (see the "Steps to take" section in the previous response). Once you have it:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üß† Train the Machine Learning Model

The API relies on a pre-trained ML model (`website_classifier_model.pkl`) and its corresponding vectorizer (`tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`). These files are **not** included in the repository and must be generated by running the training script.

1.  **Run the training script:**
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```
    This script will download some sample data, train the `LogisticRegression` model, and save the `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl` and `website_classifier_model.pkl` files in your project root directory.

    **Note:** The `train_model.py` you provided has a very small dataset for demonstration. For a truly robust and accurate classifier, you'll need significantly more diverse and larger datasets with many examples per category.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the FastAPI Application

Once the ML model files are generated, you can start the FastAPI server.

1.  **Ensure your virtual environment is active.** (If not, activate it as shown in "Installation" step 3).

2.  **Start the Uvicorn server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
    ```
    (The `--reload` flag is useful for development, as it restarts the server automatically on code changes.)

    You should see output indicating that the server is running, typically on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## üî¨ Usage

### Web Interface (UI)

Open your web browser and navigate to:
`http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

You will see a simple input field where you can enter a website URL and click "Classify Website" to see the results.

### API Endpoint (Programmatic Usage)

You can also interact with the API directly using `curl` or any HTTP client (like Postman, Insomnia, or a Python `requests` script).

**Endpoint:** `POST /classify`
**Content-Type:** `application/json`

**Example Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST "[http://127.0.0.1:8000/classify](http://127.0.0.1:8000/classify)" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"url": "[https://www.nytimes.com/](https://www.nytimes.com/)"}'
